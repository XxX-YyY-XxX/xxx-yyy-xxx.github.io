# Tactical Doll Skills

### In terms of M950a's Mod skill, what node is the theatre stage?

> Non-allied. Occupied or otherwise. Also applicable to all combat sims.

### Can KSVK's 2nd skill crit/miss?

> [Apparently it's coded like an explosive/grenade](https://iopwiki.com/wiki/KSVK). Main shot can miss and crit, while resulting explosion can't.

### How does a certain doll's skill work?

> [M1897 Mod.](https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/osihvd/weekly_commanders_lounge_july_27_2021/h72czw7/)

### What's Unity Skill?

> Skill that activates when you have both of the prerequisite dolls in the same echelon. Can be acquired by going through Bookshelf of Memories<!-- link --> in the Data Room.
>
> You'll see it sandwiched between Base Skill and MOD Skill, collapsed. <!-- @ Visuak -->
>
> As for those who have it, G36 + Springfield, Grizzly + Pzb39, AKAlfa + M82.

### Can SAA MOD trigger M500 MOD?

> Even better. It still works even after the initial three procs are used. Just make sure to cover the first few seconds of no shield.

### Which skills are able to get critical hits?

> Rule of thumb: Unless otherwise stated, all skillshots, grenades, and molotovs don't get critical hits.

### How do I stop my Kord/CMS/Dorothy from cycling through their skills?

> Go to their Armory status page, tap the Forced Manual at the top-right of their skill to on/orange. Enjoy.

### How do I know if NTW will use her second skill?

> Apparently as long as the kill check is satisfied.

### What happens when I put Px4 with guaranteed crit skills?

> Crit damage is buffed and crit chance always procs.
