>I can't hit the enemies in night missions. What do I do?

Read the above answer again. Anyway, to elaborate, your accuracy is multiplied by 0.1 so a 100 accuracy which may or may not have a scope equipped will turn to 10. And this is before all skills and buffs are taken into account.

>Help. My Echelon is not good enough to tackle a specific group of enemies.

# For Fixing and Peer Review



## Fix

### Any substitute for [brainlets damage](http://brainlets.moe/gf/sim/) [sim](https://brainlets.moe/)?

> [Github version](https://github.com/umang-p/brainlets) and 
[non-English version](https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon.html) for starters. [ATM](https://gfl.matsuda.tips/combatsim/) has one too.

### What would be the best strat for pulling?

### Where can I get the limited drop/equipment in a particular map?

> Enter the map>Combat Info>Rewards>Tap the one you want to get>Look for glowing enemies in the map>Defeat said enemies. You can also S Rank the map for an additional chance.

### I just had a skirmish and saw that my team isn't in proper formation. Can I fix it without quitting the map?

### Can dolls gain affection in auto battles?

> Yes. Also stated in-game through loading screens that you can do so.

### How do I use Construction Fairy effectively?

> Deploy on a node next to an enemy, then take a defensive stance.

### How do I use Landmine?

> Stand on a node. Lay it down on an adjacent empty node. It activates the moment an enemy steps on it. Don't retreat the mine layer or you'll lose the mine.

### What do I do with unused Keycards during the bingo event?

> Keep them. You'll get 5 Calibration Tickets per 1 Unused Keycard. Points go to trash. Source: Game info tab.

### Where can I see rankings?

> Tap the bottom-right arrow at the main screen.

### Can I get limited event dolls during rescue events using autobattles?

> "These T-Dolls are obtainable through Auto-Battles as well." Hmm... I wonder. Note however that 1 auto-battle is equivalent to 1 roll for the doll.

### After winning a combat mission with my Coalition team, I noticed that they have no ammo and rations in them. Where did my resources go?

> Back to the pool. They even tell you this in the resupply screen.

Alternate way to saving a target:

Tap the radar button right above "Planning Mode" the screen will have a scanning animation. Tap on Dana and you can save her as a target after tapping "Add Target". You can use this information in the future though.
Tap the radar button again to move your echelons or terminate mission.
