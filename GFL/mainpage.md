>I can't hit the enemies in night missions. What do I do?

Read the above answer again. Anyway, to elaborate, your accuracy is multiplied by 0.1 so a 100 accuracy which may or may not have a scope equipped will turn to 10. And this is before all skills and buffs are taken into account.

>Help. My Echelon is not good enough to tackle a specific group of enemies.

1. CE is a trash metric in this case.

2. Post your echelon and dolls using Imgur.

# For Fixing and Peer Review



## Fix

### Any substitute for [brainlets damage](http://brainlets.moe/gf/sim/) [sim](https://brainlets.moe/)?

> [Github version](https://github.com/umang-p/brainlets) and 
[non-English version](https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon.html) for starters. [ATM](https://gfl.matsuda.tips/combatsim/) has one too. [Hycdes.](https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon-EN.html) You can use [this](https://github.com/neko-gg/gfl-combat-simulator/releases/tag/v0.6)^(by elgatoroid) to train yourself with specific comps. [GFAlarm](https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/mzp707/polarised_light_megathread/gza8jng/) can be used as one too.

### What does total exp in the auto-battle completion mean?

> <iframe id="reddit-embed" src="https://www.redditmedia.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/hzark0/weekly_commanders_lounge_july_28_2020/g082rwn/?depth=1&amp;showmore=false&amp;embed=true&amp;showmedia=false&amp;theme=dark" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" style="border: none;" height="195" width="640" scrolling="no"></iframe>

### What would be the best strat for pulling?

> - Save Svarog (bottom-right) and Extra Impulses (top-right, the +N next to Regular Impulses) until you get to the pool you want to pull. Regular Impulses are free real estate.

> - [In-depth guide for maximum efficiency.](https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/ojazqj/weekly_commanders_lounge_july_13_2021/h5gg71b/)

## Clarify

### Is there a recipe that focuses on a single doll?

> Not too sure about any of these.

> Above 920 total resources used: Excludes HG.

> G11: 297, 297, 297, 31

> All 30 5* HGs: Grizzly, NZ75, Px4, and PA-15 <!--u/Rhasta_la_vista-->

### When does the impulse regen timer stop?

> When the regenerating impulse reaches 14? Forgot. Guides seem to suggest it is though.

### Does retreating a doll during battle/skirmish have an effect on affection points?

> Nope. They ONLY lose some if they or other dolls in the group died during mob battles. And auto-battles DO NOT decrease/affect^(w/e the case may be)^ affection points.

### Can I get limited event dolls during rescue events using autobattles?

> "These T-Dolls are obtainable through Auto-Battles as well." Hmm... I wonder. Note however that 1 auto-battle is equivalent to 1 roll for the doll.







## Check

Alternate way to saving a target:

Tap the radar button right above "Planning Mode" the screen will have a scanning animation. Tap on Dana and you can save her as a target after tapping "Add Target". You can use this information in the future though.
Tap the radar button again to move your echelons or terminate mission.
