# For Fixing and Peer Review

## Fix

### Any substitute for [brainlets damage](http://brainlets.moe/gf/sim/) [sim](https://brainlets.moe/)?

> [Github version](https://github.com/umang-p/brainlets) and 
[non-English version](https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon.html) for starters. [ATM](https://gfl.matsuda.tips/combatsim/) has one too. [Hycdes.](https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon-EN.html) You can use [this](https://github.com/neko-gg/gfl-combat-simulator/releases/tag/v0.6)^(by elgatoroid) to train yourself with specific comps. [GFAlarm](https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/mzp707/polarised_light_megathread/gza8jng/) can be used as one too.

>
> G11: 297, 297, 297, 31

### When all doll DPS contribution is equal, who becomes the MVP?

>
> Case 1:
>   Acquire order: G36c > 56R > XM3 > RMB > AK15
>   MVP: ~~RMB~~AK15
> Case 2:
>   Acquire order: G36c > 56R > XM3 > RMB > Jashin
>   MVP: Jashin

## Visual

### Where can I get the limited drop/equipment in a particular map?

> Enter the map>Combat Info>Rewards>Tap the one you want to get>Look for glowing enemies in the map>Defeat said enemies. You can also S Rank the map for an additional chance.

### I see people have their Tdolls as their avatar in other peoples dorms. How do you do that?

## Check

Alternate way to saving a target:

Tap the radar button right above "Planning Mode" the screen will have a scanning animation. Tap on Dana and you can save her as a target after tapping "Add Target". You can use this information in the future though.
Tap the radar button again to move your echelons or terminate mission.
