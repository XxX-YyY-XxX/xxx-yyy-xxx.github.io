# Neural Upgrade/MOD

### I can't see my dolls MOD in the Neural Upgrade tab.

> Uh, yes? Costumes are this game's main revenue, so locking you to use only MOD3 art is stupid. And it also kinda locks you on MOD3 voicelines unless you use their original art.

### I just got an Old Letter. WhoWhenWhereWhatWhyHow?

> KSVK. After Modding her to 3. Mail. Connected to Mod Story. More story and immersion. Mica mail.
