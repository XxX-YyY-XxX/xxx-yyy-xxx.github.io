### What's the Fire Control Core for?

> Necessary for modding 5★ dolls.

### What's the time frame for modding dolls?

> From their release until EOS.

### Which dolls have a Mod in the older servers?

### If I Mod my T-doll, is Level 100 still considered max level?

> Thankfully, this is where common sense wins. In short, **NO**.

### Who should I MOD first?

### Can I use duplicates to raise my doll's MOD level?

> Yes, unless you're modding 2★ dolls. First, go to factory then dismantle all dupes. When you get enough cores, you can use them to raise MOD levels.

### I'm planning to use a max level oathed MOD doll to farm surplus exp. Is that a good idea?

> As good an idea as running an unmodded max level doll.

### I can't see my dolls MOD in the Neural Upgrade tab.

> Maybe because it's not yet released on whatever server you're in right now?

### If I mod my doll, would I still be able to use other skins?

> Uh, yes? Costumes are this game's main revenue, so locking you to use only MOD3 art is stupid. And it also kinda locks you on MOD3 voicelines unless you use their original art.
