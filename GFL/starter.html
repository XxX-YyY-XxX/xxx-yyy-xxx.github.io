                    <dd>In-game facility called Forward Basecamp that gives a bevy of items for raising Tactical Dolls (your main fighting force).</dd>
                    <dd>Protocol Assimilation for steamrolling early to mid-game content.</dd>
                    <dd>Newbie Career Quests that gives free preleveled units where some of them, namely AR Team, are meta viable.</dd>

                    <dd>The only permanently missable ones are mainly minigame cosmetics.</dd>
                    <dd>Major events? Campaign Missions. Banner units? None here. Collabs? Reruns are possible (Note: they're not gamebreaking).</dd>

                    <dt>Stamina</dt>
                    <dd>There is no stamina. But it has a rough equivalent in Manpower, Ammunition, Ration, and Part resources, which can be gathered in bulk indefinitely.</dd>

                    <dt>Storage</dt>
                    <dd>Android ahould be around 5-6GB, iOS is around 10GB.</dd>

                    <dd>This game will only ever end once they've told all the stories they want to tell. Which is still a lot as of now.</dd>

                <a href="#pvp" id="pvp"><h1>Is there PVP in this game?</h1></a>
                <p>There are two kinds of PVP in this game, the highscore leaderboards type (Theater and Event Ranking Maps) and direct (Luffberry Chess).</p>
                <p>If you're looking for a more traditional PVP, luckily/unluckily this game doesn't have it.</p>

                <a href="#engage" id="engage"><h1>How much daily engagement does this game need?</h1></a>
                <p>Minimal. Resources for pulls are generated passively. Events are months apart aka big bursts in-between lulls (in comparison to usual mobages).</p>

                <a href="#gacha" id="gacha"><h1>How is the gacha in this game?</h1></a>
                <p>The only gacha in this game is cosmetics. Characters/Units/Dolls in this game do not go on a rotating banner, instead once they enter the "gacha pool", they're available permanently. In essence, this game is not a gacha game in terms of unit pulling.</p>

                <a href="#reroll" id="reroll"><h1>Is it worth to reroll in this game?</h1></a>
                <p>Depends on what you value more. If you want a pretty easy time until endgame, game already gives you free strong dolls as part of the newbie missions. Endgame? This is a game of accumulating various tools instead of just a select few meta characters due to the volatile meta shifts. Collab units? They're not gacha or rather, you're guaranteed to get them with a working team.</p>
                <p>TLDR; For the most part, the answer is no.</p>

                <a href="#F2P" id="F2P"><h1>Is this game F2P?</h1></a>
                <p>Very much so to the point that quite a number of them are top rankers in major event rankings. It's more about the breadth of units you have than the power of each individual unit.</p>
                <p>The only "P2W" is Protocol Assimilation, especially concerning Ringleaders, though it's more of pay to catch-up than anything. It's a major power boost to beginners, a crutch for mid-game players, and an occasional useful tool during end game.</p>

                <p>Not anytime soon considering that they're still adding mechanics in its 7th year and there are more stories to tell. The plan is for all games to be played simultaneously.</p>
