# Field Map

### I just had a skirmish and saw that my team isn't in proper formation. Can I fix it without quitting the map?

### How do I get the gold medals in maps?

> - Read the Gold Medal description in the combat summary.
>
> - Never retreat your team from the field map either by losing skirmishes (losses) or manual retreating (withdrawing).
>
> - Never repair fielded teams (red warning at the bottom left tells you this, don't miss it).
>
> - Retreating a doll from the battle phase/skirmish is fine. Really, anything that you SHOULD DO/ SHOULD NOT DO are already listed.
>
> - Retreating Support Echelons does not prevent you from gold medals, nor does support kills (shown in green +#) count towards.
