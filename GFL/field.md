# Field Map

### My team says Ammo/Ration depleted. How do I fill it up?

> Move them to helipad, heavy helipad, HQ, or nodes with box drawn on them. Double-tap them. Resupply is yellow button at the bottom right.
>
> If you have auto-resupply on, they will be automatically supplied at the start of your turn if they stand on nodes that can resupply them.
>
> Note that the act of resupplying in and of itself costs you only rations and ammo. AP will not be consumed.

### I just had a skirmish and saw that my team isn't in proper formation. Can I fix it without quitting the map?

### How do I get the gold medals in maps?

> - Read the Gold Medal description in the combat summary.
>
> - Never retreat your team from the field map either by losing skirmishes (losses) or manual retreating (withdrawing).
>
> - Never repair fielded teams (red warning at the bottom left tells you this, don't miss it).
>
> - Retreating a doll from the battle phase/skirmish is fine. Really, anything that you SHOULD DO/ SHOULD NOT DO are already listed.
>
> - Retreating Support Echelons does not prevent you from gold medals, nor does support kills (shown in green +#) count towards.

### Why do I get the lack of ammo/ration warning and sometimes not?

> You'll get the warning when you lack either of them, when you can see the enemy, and when you engage them first in battle.
