# Expedition/Forward Basecamp

### Can I deploy two or three of the same pets in expedition?

> Actually, that is the method used by min-maxers regarding advantaged pets.

### Can the basecamp not give expedition loots?

> Only if you didn't do one. If you did and no visible loot, restart app.

### What are T-doll effects available in the older servers?

> ~~Global already has everything they have.~~ Apparently new items have been added there.
>
> "Old servers have 6 new ones, floating flowers and ground effect lighting they stole from NFS Underground. They also removed the numbers from the players 2,3&4 effects. Bonus: 3 Kalina costumes, 2 hats and a whole pile of SPEQs and event furniture."

### Which expedition duration should I do to maximize efficiency?

> 8 hours. More chances to get into hidden areas.

### What is the priority for each currency?

> Toy Block (least useful IMO) - Furnitures, batteries if really strapped.
>
> Buttstock (Most needed) - FCCs, CR/SCR if needed.
>
> Acorns - SPEQs.
>
> Bottle - Cores, effects for posterity.
