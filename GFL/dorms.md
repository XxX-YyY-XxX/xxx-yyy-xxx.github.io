# Dormitories

### How do friend batteries work?

> Friend batteries recharge at 3am and 3pm UTC-8. The number of charges depends on the number of dorms your friend has. Use Netlify if you want to know when it resets.

### Why aren't my dorm batteries appearing?

> It's not their time to appear yet.

### Which dolls appear in which dorms?

> Echelon position corresponds to dorm positions i.e. Echelon 1 in Dorm 1, Echelon 2 in Dorm 2, etc.

### What are all the available pets right now?

> [Pets available in Rescue Station.](http://dmesse.egloos.com/m/3588696). If you see a pet that is not on this list, it's a Cafe Story reward, collab pet, or event reward that haven't been added yet to the station.

### What are spare dorms and what are they for?

> They're dorm rooms that act as presets by saving dorm configuration with 6 free slots. They can also be used to swap dorm order. Also, they don't contribute to battery generation.

### How many hours do visitors stay in the dorm?

> 8\.

### I see posters of certain dolls on some of my friends' dorm walls. How do I get them?

> It's either from a skin where you give it to a doll, mail reward, or a campaign poster that can bought in the cafe.
