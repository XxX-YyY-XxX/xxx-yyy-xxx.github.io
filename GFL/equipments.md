# Equipment

### Would the equipment I'm enhancing get bonus points if I used an enhanced fodder?

> No.

### Is it fine to use green equips?

> Advised to use if lack gold ones. Do calibration only on gold ones for calibration ticket efficiency. Otherwise, fine to level them up.

### Which is more efficient for enhancing equipment, equip enhance parts or fodder equips?

> Yes. It's a matter of resource cost per point raised.

### What's the MAX in blue box in equipment mean?

> Highest calibration aka highest base stat of that particular equipment. You can calibrate in the Research menu.

### Will I be able to get maximum calibration or is that part of RNG?

> The only RNG in equipment calibration is how many tickets wasted before maxing.

### Does AA-12's SPEQ count as a slug?

> No, apparently due to lacking Ã—3 damage.

### Is there a list of Monthly Special Equipment?
