# Resupply/Costumes/Furniture

### How do I get Black Cards?

> Just give the duplicate costume. Nice and simple.

### Where are the skins? I can't find them.

> ![](/GFL/assets/images/SkinLocation.png "Dorms > Warehouse > Gifts")

### What if I don't have the doll I have costume for?

> Make Kalina wear it and give it when the owner comes home.

### Where can I get furniture for my dorms?

> Collateral of skin pulling, aka Resupply. Or Expedition shop.

### I want to clean my furniture inventory. How do I do that?

> ![](/GFL/assets/images/FurnitureTrash.png "Trash Icon")

### How does the Radiant Collection rate work?

> For normal rate, 2% divided by the number of banners in the radiant is the chance of pulling a skin from a specific banner.
>
> Pro-tip: Don't. Radiant is akin to the standard banner in gachas.

### I won't be using the costume. How can I scrap it?

> I bring this news with a heavy heart that it is impossible. Deal with it.

### What's the difference between L2D and Simplified L2D?

> L2D 
> - Reactive/full Live2D (the one where their eyes follow your touch).
>
> Simplified L2D
> - Animations on loop, except when they talk.

### Do Gem Package skins go to Black Card Exchange?

> Some do, some don't. What's sure is that gem pack collab skins are gem packs only. Obviously.

### Where can I get reactive L2Ds?

> Resupply.

### When will the costumes go to the Black Card Exchange?

> After around 2 banners.

### How can I obtain the wedding/oath skins for some T-dolls?

> Oath skins? Watchu smoking? There's no oath skins, only gacha/free/paid skins.

### What are the furniture sets as of now?

> [Everyhting CN has to offer.](http://www.gfwiki.org/w/%E5%AE%B6%E5%85%B7)
