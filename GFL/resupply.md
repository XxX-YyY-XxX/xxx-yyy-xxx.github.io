### How does the Radiant Collection rate work?

> For normal rate, 2% divided by the number of banners in the radiant is the chance of pulling a skin from a specific banner.
>
> Pro-tip: Don't. Radiant is akin to the standard banner in gachas.

### I won't be using the costume. How can I scrap it?

> I bring this news with a heavy heart that it is impossible. Deal with it.

### What's the difference between L2D and Simplified L2D?

> L2D 
> - Reactive/full Live2D (the one where their eyes follow your touch).
>
> Simplified L2D
> - Animations on loop, except when they talk.

### Do Gem Package skins go to Black Card Exchange?

> Some do, some don't. What's sure is that gem pack collab skins are gem packs only. Obviously.

### Where can I get reactive L2Ds?

> Resupply.

### When will the costumes go to the Black Card Exchange?

> After around 2 banners.

### How can I obtain the wedding/oath skins for some T-dolls?

> Oath skins? Watchu smoking? There's no oath skins, only gacha/free/paid skins.
