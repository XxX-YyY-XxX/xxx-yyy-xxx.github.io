[Powercycling means literally closing/exiting/terminating the app, then launching it back up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85xwZ_OLX0&feature=youtu.be) If that still doesn't solve it, the following questions could. Or do the following then restart.

>Where to go for tech support?

FB and Twitter is said to be responsive enough. Or you can use [this](https://forms.gle/bZNnQeh5sJaD3pim8) for reporting.

>My game freezes on a night map. What happened?

~~Griffin sabotaged your friend support because they are all you need.~~ Griffin apologized for the sabotage. They now allow you to call a friend. Though, if it still happens, Griffin lied.

>The tutorial froze. What should I do?

Eh, it happens. Consensus is just skip it. Apparently it bricks on devices wider than 16:9 landscape mode.

>I got an "Illegal Action Detected" warning. What happened?

Mostly desync and having "invalid" inputs. Just restart it.

>How does GFL check the screen ratio?

>Game keeps getting stuck in the title screen. Fetching server, download screen...

Switch between WiFi/Data. Else use VPN.

>Game is not available in my Play Store. How can I play this game?

QooApp or Apkpure.

>Update progress is stuck at 90%/100%. What should I do?

Wait a minute, change WiFi connection, change to data, use VPN, restart client, [do a manual patch](https://github.com/lloyddunamis/gfl_manualpatch/blob/main/FullResource_readme), [delete some files](https://mobile.twitter.com/Synexcu/status/1310117595094216709?s=19), or reinstall (with minimum data first).

>Enemy mortar keeps shooting me and I don't know who the target is.

Battle Simplification in Settings is set to on probably.

>My game freezes upon winning a battle. What happened?

Popular answer: Memory Leaks. Restart client is always the default option.

>Just bought a gem pack/monthly card but I didn't get it yet. What do I do?

Go through the process again then back out at the payment screen. If it fails, contact support first if you're planning a refund.

>How much storage does this game consume?

Iphones? Sub 10GB apparently because no compression and trash files. Android? Sub 5GB. And if the game wants to piss you off? Double of those, because dupe spaghetti.

>My game is lagging. Is there a way to make this playable?

>I lost my account. How do I get it back?

Costumer support. It might be easier to locate it if you did a purchase with that account.

>Why does the iOS version crash a lot?

Grapevine: Mix iOS RAM overload prevention and GFL memory leak, and you have a totally definitely good time.
