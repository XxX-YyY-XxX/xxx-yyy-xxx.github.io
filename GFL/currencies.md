# Resource Management

### How are the limited bonus gems for the monrhly card applied?

> Only within the time the event is ongoing, which is for a week. Note that it immediately becomes active as long as a monthly gem is active, old or new purchase.

### Where can I use Calibration Tickets?

> Equipment Calibration, Fairy Talent Calibration, HOC Chip Rotation, More Anticipation...

### Do first purchase gem bonus reset?

> Only on server anniversary which, on Global, is on May.

### If I buy multiple Monthly Gem Packages, will it stack?

> As in more than 30 a day? No. It being a 2 month distribution? Yes.

### Which should I prioritize in the Data Room, Combat Reports or Special Combat Reports?

> SCRs primarily because you can just EXP sim, corpse drag, and auto-battle the dolls, and also because basecamp sells far more CR than SCR. Note that you'd need 5000 SCRs to fully level a fresh HOC.

### I've seen players have around 500 T-doll contracts. How did they have that much?

> Logistics and limiting production to 4 a day. The last one basically applies to long-time players though.

### When do we get discounted tokens?

> Around x-mas, cny, anni, April 16 week, and the likes.

### Why are the gem package names incorrect/confusing?

### If I bought a Monthly Gem Card, do I get them immediately every day or do I have to log-in?

> Sent as mail, procured as mail, expires as mail.

### Anyone knows what resources and how much do we get for a failed PA capture?

> ![](/GFL/assets/images/CaptureFail.png "Slashes are because probability")

### How many combat reports should I have ideally?

> 660 CRs to raise a doll from Lv.1 to Lv.90. As for how much is the recommended stock, if your main source of raising dolls is map leveling/corpse dragging, you'll get a truck load of them before you know it.
