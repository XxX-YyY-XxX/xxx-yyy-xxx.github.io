# Third Party

### Any substitute for [brainlets damage](http://brainlets.moe/gf/sim/) [sim](https://brainlets.moe/)?

> [Github version](https://github.com/umang-p/brainlets) and 
[non-English version](https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon.html) for starters. [ATM](https://gfl.matsuda.tips/combatsim/) has one too. [Hycdes.](https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon-EN.html) You can use [this](https://github.com/neko-gg/gfl-combat-simulator/releases/tag/v0.6)^(by elgatoroid) to train yourself with specific comps. [GFAlarm](https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/mzp707/polarised_light_megathread/gza8jng/) can be used as one too.

> A lot of emulator players still use them, especially for [kiting](https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/hmqhw8/weekly_commanders_lounge_july_07_2020/fxgu8g8/), so if you're willing to take the risk, go for it. Macros ARE a bannable offense, full stop.

### When will dorm battery, daily gift, friend battery reset?

> [Netlify timer.](https://gftimers.netlify.app/) Note that ranking updates one hour after Kalina's Daily Gift.

### Is there a way to know the deployed enemies and map layout?

> [Pengu site.](https://pengupengupengu.github.io/gflmaps/)

### Why does this game download the game files when I open it?

> Either you just open it up at the most opportune of times or you close the Bluestacks emulator directly before closing the GFL app.
