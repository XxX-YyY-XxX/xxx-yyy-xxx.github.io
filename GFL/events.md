# Events

### Why didn't I complete "Consume 100 batteries" for the bingo mission when I EXP trained my HOCs?

> Because you can get them back, that's what. It only counts when the training is finished, meaning there's no way to take it back.

@ Link

### Do auto-battles count for "Defeat Enemies"?

> No.

### What do I do with unused Keycards during the bingo event?

> Keep them. You'll get 5 Calibration Tickets per 1 Unused Keycard. Points go to trash. Source: Game info tab.

@ Visual

### Will the current event currency carry over to the next event?

> No. Event currencies are for the current ones only.

### When will my event medals expire?

> One week after the end of said event.

### Will the \*insert ranking reward here* be available in the future?

> Only if they rerun ranking maps.

### Where can I see rankings?

> Tap the bottom-right arrow at the main screen.

@ Visual

### I wasn't able to clear the event. Will I still get the clear rewards when they get added to Campaign?

> Nope. Gutted rewards compared to original. Free shit is free shit, and doll rewards gets cycled to Limited Dolls.

### What's the optimal way of clearing ~~Bingo~~ Key Card Events?

> Using the Targeted Draws to fully clear the board in one go.

### Counter says I still have maps to do. How do I know which ones are those?

> ![](/GFL/assets/images/StoryProgress.png "Tap the encircled counter to see the remaining maps")

### What's a rescue event?

> Events where you get to farm for [sought-after 4-5â˜… dolls](/GFL/tdolls#is-there-a-comprehensive-list-of-limited-event-dolls) in the story chapters 1-6.

### Can I get limited event dolls during rescue events using autobattles?

> "These T-Dolls are obtainable through Auto-Battles as well." Hmm... I wonder. Note however that 1 auto-battle is equivalent to 1 roll for the doll.

### I've been getting dupes about 3 days when the Key Card Event started. What gives?

> First, "Coupon Collector's Problem". Second, [it actually kinda seems rigged to some extent.](https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/o5hpk4/weekly_commanders_lounge_june_22_2021/h2pa27f/)

### When will the current event end?

> If major event or collab, 4 weeks after start. If minor of mini events, 3 weeks after start.
