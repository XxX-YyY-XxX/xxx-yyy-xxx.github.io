### Is there any way to reset my battles so I can get a win?

> Turn off WiFi during battle. You can still finish the fight with no connection. Though be wary of connection timeouts so do it near the end.
>
> If you don't like the result or you lost, exit client, turn on WiFi, re-enter client, take the fight again.
>
> If satisfied ~~or saving your sanity~~, turn on WiFi after the battle finished.

### How can I save the enemy composition for later practice?

> Add Target
> - Long press the enemy on the map and you'll see the Add Target button on the top-left.
> - Pause while in battle to see the Add Target button on the bottom-left. 
> - Add Target appears on the bottom-left after losing a battle.

> GFAlarm
> - Use the Custom Packet Forger to fight enemies by ID taken from [GFLMaps](https://pengupengupengu.github.io/gflmaps/), and entered [here](https://imgur.com/PjXW14n). Works for comps that has been loaded into the client.
