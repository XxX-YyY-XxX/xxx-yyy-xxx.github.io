> On that note, retreating dolls who had their buffs activate will not remove said buff. Also, tile buffs don't degrade even if your dummy count does.

### Does retreating a doll during battle/skirmish have an effect on affection points?

> Nope. They ONLY lose some if they or other dolls in the group died during mob battles. And auto-battles DO NOT decrease/affect^(w/e the case may be)^ affection points.
