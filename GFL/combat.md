# Combat/Battle/Skirmish

### Will I lose the tile buffs if my dolls retreated/moved/lose link/die ?

> TLDW: No.

> On that note, retreating dolls who had their buffs activate will not remove said buff. Also, tile buffs don't degrade even if your dummy count does.

### Why are the doll skills not activating?

> Is the auto skill button on? Is it on forced manual? Is it a flare skill?
>
> Skills cannot activate when they cannot shoot, i.e. SG/MG reloading, dolls moving, no enemy in range, no ammo/ration.

### Does retreating a doll during battle/skirmish have an effect on affection points?

> Nope. They ONLY lose some if they or other dolls in the group died during mob battles. And auto-battles DO NOT decrease/affect^(w/e the case may be) affection points.

### Do HP shields stack?

### How do I deal with enemies with armor?

> Use dolls that can equip AP ammo.

### Do debuffs stick if I retreat my dolls?

> Rudimentary testing says no. Mainly applies to enemy side on-screen effects like molotovs, smoke, grenade, stun, etc.

### Can I change which dolls get targetted by the enemy?

### I keep fat-fingering my kiting. Any help?

> To move a doll, you tap on their feet, not on their body. Or use emulators.

### Can I zoom out during combat?

> You'd have to zoom in first. If you mean zooming well outside the doll's shooting range, then no.

### Is there any way to reset my battles so I can get a win?

### How do I stop my dolls from retreating on critical damage?

> Heavy Damage Protection off in Game Settings or in Combat Pause Settings.
