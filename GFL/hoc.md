> Or just have the chip calc do the heavy lifting.

### When do I get to unlock the whole HOC grid/matrix/board?

> At full promotion. The yellow ★★★★★ one.

### How do HOC skills work?

> Depends. Either by timer or by number of shots fired. And all skills are active, meaning no need to choose which one you'll use.

### Can HOCs reduce armor just like they do with force shields?

> No. Armor is a stat, not a gauge.

### How do I unlock new HOCs?

> From chip analyzer or from their status page (accessible through garage or echelon formation).

### What's the rate for HOC rate-up?

> No exact numbers, but note that it only increases the chance of getting a particular HOC's Central Data. Rate for Data as a whole remains unchanged.
