### Which HOCs should I raise first?

> 1. 2B14
> 2. BGM-71 (doesn't need iteration to be effective)
> 3. M2
> 4. Mk 153
> 5. AT4
> 6. AGS-30 (needs iteration to compete with others)
> 7. QLZ-04
> 8. PP-93

### When do I get to unlock the whole HOC grid/matrix/board?

> At full promotion. The yellow ★★★★★ one.

### Which HOC can destroy buildings?

> All of them. Building damage uses the Pierce stat.

### How can I get Data Patches?

> Either from the Code Refactoring menu in the Garage or getting a 5★'d HOC's Core Data.

### What are Data Patches used for?

> For Iterating FSTs beyond yellow 5★. They have to be level 100 and at 5★ for Iteration to be available.

### What are these General Data I keep getting?

> Used for HOCs that are not yet 5★. Limitations being only usable to HOCs in the gacha pool, and the data can't be used for iteration.
>
> If you plan to big brain with this, churn your HOC-specific central data first to patches, because they're the priority data to use before general data.

### How do HOC skills work?

> Depends. Either by timer or by number of shots fired. And all skills are active, meaning no need to choose which one you'll use.

### Can HOCs reduce armor just like they do with force shields?

> No. Armor is a stat, not a gauge.

### How do I unlock new HOCs?

> From chip analyzer or from their status page (accessible through garage or echelon formation).

@ Visual

### What's the rate for HOC rate-up?

> No exact numbers, but note that it only increases the chance of getting a particular HOC's Central Data. Rate for Data as a whole remains unchanged.

### How do I strengthen FSTs?

> - Leveling up mostly be CR.
> - Skill levels.
> - Iterations (only available at LV100 and 5★).
> - Enhancements using pills.
> - Chips.
