### When do I get to unlock the whole HOC grid/matrix/board?

### How can I get Data Patches?

> Either from the Code Refactoring menu in the Garage or getting a 5★'d HOC's Core Data.

### What are Data Patches used for?

> For Iterating FSTs beyond yellow 5★. They have to be level 100 and at 5★ for Iteration to be available.

### How do HOC skills work?

> Depends. Either by timer or by number of shots fired. And all skills are active, meaning no need to choose which one you'll use.

### Can HOCs reduce armor just like they do with force shields?

> No. Armor is a stat, not a gauge.

### How do I unlock new HOCs?

> From chip analyzer or from their status page (accessible through garage or echelon formation).
