# Theater

### What does "Settle Reward" do? It sounds ominous.

> More like "Settlement Reward". Just shows you things you'll get once Theater ends.

### How much CE do I need for a good score?

> For dolls, MODs and oaths take the forefrnt with advantaged dolls having +20% CE than usual.
>
> For fairies, they only need to be 5★ and Lv. 100.
>
> For HOCs, maxed out PA is better in stack but worse in battle.

### I wasn't able to place high enough to 5★ the reward HOC. Is there another way to get their central data?

> Odd numbered theater? Even the Top 1 can't anyway.
>
> Even numbered theater? Wait for the next theater and they'll join the HOC gacha.

### I'm thinking of using Landmine Fairy. Will they work?

> Well yes... as a stat stick. Can't use a Strategy Fairy skill in theater ~~mostly because you can't tap a node to activate it in the first place~~. Stick to Combat Fairies if you want to use skills.

### Is Core/Critical Zone harder than Advanced?

> Core 8 yes. To be clear, Core 1-3 is like Easy, Core 4-6 are Intermediate, and Core 7-8 are Advanced.

### What is the "Final Battle" tab in Theater Ranking?

> Highest score you obtained in Core 8 stage.
