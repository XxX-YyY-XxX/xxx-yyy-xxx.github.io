# Theater

### How to do Theater?

> Note that advantaged dolls no longer makes or breaks the run and echelon formation is 1 team + backups.

TLDR is 5-6 Defense Drills in a row, twice per day, with differing battle effects and restrictions applied. And scouting gambling where you pick one zone.

### Do I have to save HOC charges and Fairy points for the boss?

> Nope. Joins boss battle regardless of charges. Replenishes on next raid. Go ham.

### What does "Settle Reward" do? It sounds ominous.

> More like "Settlement Reward". Just shows you things you'll get once Theater ends.

### How much CE do I need for a good score?

> You know the times when people say CE is useless? This is not one of those times.

> | SG | 8000 |

> For fairies, they only need to be 5★ and Lv. 100.

### I can't beat the current stage. Is this it for me?

> Nope. Just fall back to the last boss node you can handle. These nodes can mitigate the "beaten stage" penalty so it's worth more than non-boss higher node.

### I wasn't able to place high enough to 5★ the reward HOC. Is there another way to get their central data?

> Odd numbered theater? Even the Top 1 can't anyway.
>
> Even numbered theater? Wait for the next theater and they'll join the HOC gacha.

### I'm thinking of using Landmine Fairy. Will they work?

> Well yes... as a stat stick. Can't use a Strategy Fairy skill in theater ~~mostly because you can't tap a node to activate it in the first place~~. Stick to Combat Fairies if you want to use skills.

### Is Core/Critical Zone harder than Advanced?

> Core 8 yes. To be clear, Core 1-3 is like Easy, Core 4-6 are Intermediate, and Core 7-8 are Advanced.

### What is the "Final Battle" tab in Theater Ranking?

> Highest score you obtained in Core 8 stage.
