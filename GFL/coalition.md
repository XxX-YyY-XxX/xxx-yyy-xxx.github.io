### There's too much to read for Protocol Assimilation. Is there a TLDR for it?

### Is there a tier list for good PA units?

### How do I build Coalition echelons?

> [For your flowcharting needs.](https://redd.it/rkvisq)

### Where can I get Svarog Aid Commissions/Tickets and Extra Impulse?

> 2 from daily log-ins, 1 from weekly, gem shop, event rewards for Svarog.

### What would be the best strat for pulling?

> - Save Svarog (bottom-right) and Extra Impulses (top-right, the +N next to Regular Impulses) until you get to the pool you want to pull. Regular Impulses are free real estate.

>
> - If using Svarog Tickets, do it one at a time. 10x is just 1 pull done 10 times.
>
> Note that if you get a displayed unit using the ticket, the whole impulse capture pool (the 3 units shown) will reset... probably. <!-- @ Fix -->

@ Fix

### Why are my XS units getting auto-locked?

> Because tutorial said so? Only applies to first XS and XL copy of a particular unit.

@ Visual

### What's the Coalition Combat Drill priority?

> Data>Dish>Report. Subject to change without prior notice.

### Where to get kernels?

> Supernova = 2-3★. Dark Star = 1★.

### After winning a combat mission with my Coalition team, I noticed that they have no ammo and rations in them. Where did my resources go?

> Back to the pool. They even tell you this in the resupply screen.

@ Visual

### When is the 10 Svarog aid bundle in the shop available?

> Everytime there is a new banner.

### If the Ringleader appears for a capture, will I guarantee her when I use Svarog aid?

> No. It pulls from the entire pool where the entire pool is the X in the X/100 units.

### What is Peak Value Analysis?

> Dummy-linking basically. But dupes are required.

### If I fail to capture a coalition unit, will I lose them?

> Rather than that, they're recycled back into the pool.

### Is there any way to rewatch the tutorial?

### What happens to the reshuffle/refresh timer when the banner changes?

> Restarts from the top. Meaning refreshing just hours before Ringleader change has the same effect as refreshing 2 days ago.

### How do I get duplicate ringleaders?

> If you successfully captured the RL, there is a "Reset Pool" button beside the Svarog button. This allows you to refresh the pool back to 100 for another round of RL pulling. Dupe RLs are autofed to your first copy. Any more pulls of the same RL with full petal is an autoscrap.

### What does size imply in regards to PA units?

> Stats. Bigger is better. Also subject to RNG, by impulse or svarog capture, or by kernel shop.

### Is it a good idea to get duplicate Ringleaders and Manticores (aka one-link units) for linking/PVA?

> Good? Yes. Necessary? Not really, since they be powerful enough already.

### When will <insert unit/ringleader> appear?

> ![](/GFL/assets/images/SFSched.png "Basically the order of release")

### I see a golden glow on my Coalition unit. What's it for?

> Lazy cosmetic difference stating that it's a shiny ~~pokemon~~ unit.
>

> You can give it to another unit in the same place with Symmetric Infusion.

@ Visual

### Can I increase the ringleader's 25% capture rate?

> Drop the pool until you have 3/100 then use Svarog tickets.

### How does Symmetric Infusion work exactly?

> Basically, swaps sizes. Technically, swaps all stats aside from size. If both sides are upgraded, say Lv. 31 and Lv. 23, they become 23 and 31, not 1 and 31+. Check the unit lock to prevent foddering th raised one.

### Why is the PA notification (right side) always lit up?

> Most likely because RL is still in the pool. Please confirm.

@ Clarify

### Do I need Dummy Cores for upgrading Coalition Units?

> No. They have their own resources.

### Which one should I upgrade first in the Protocol Center?

> Impulse Reactor for more pulls then everything else.

### When does the impulse regen timer stop?

> When the regenerating impulse reaches 14? Forgot. Guides seem to suggest it is though.

### Can I change the command type (Defend/Charge/Destroy) automatically?

> No can do for now.

### I have one copy of a ringleader. Can I scrap them?

> Why would you? How could you? Can you even anyway?

### How are the Striker's ROF calculated?

> <iframe id="reddit-embed" src="https://www.redditmedia.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/qkzc9s/weekly_commanders_lounge_november_02_2021/hjecs3p/?depth=1&amp;showmore=false&amp;embed=true&amp;showmedia=false&amp;theme=dark" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" style="border: none;" height="259" width="640" scrolling="no"></iframe>

### I want a specific unit. How will I be able to pull for them in this banner?

> Pulses. Note that this only works for the three units on the field at that time. Once an attempt is made, get or no, they will be replaced with another unit.
>
> Svarog. Pulls from the entire pool, but chances depend on how many are left in the pool.

### Where do I get transfer catalysts?

> Daily gifts, failed captures, PA store.

### Where can I see stat previews of of PA units?

> [Protocol Assimilation Units Stats.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TYKbdjuOdOMsvaaIduWW_8FF0tm27BjwKbC4uggl1wE)

### What are Petri Dishes for?

> Raising Coalition units' rarity.

### After a banner ends, would the extra impulses and aid commissions expire?

> They're basically the equivalent of gacha currency, so it wouldn't make sense for them to expire.

### My RL is bigger than she was before. Wuh huppun?

> Dummy links maybe?
