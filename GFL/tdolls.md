### What's the drop rate for farmable dolls?

> Limited dolls on chapters have 0.8% drop rate on normal and 1% on emergency. Event farms have around 1%. 5★ on normal maps have rates way below 1%... usually. Droprates at Chapter 10 and above seem to have higher rates.

### How do I know the final value of the doll stats? And what are the caps for each stat?

> [Matsuda Formula.](https://gfl.matsuda.tips/post/basicformula)
>
> 99999 for final damage. FOR ROF, it's listed on the formation screen, but in reality, it's by 5, so max for 120 is 116, i.e. 116-120 ROF has no difference. Crit Rate is 100% as per common sense.

### Can I set the damaged art as default for dolls?

> Only on the main screen as an adjutant, unless you want them critically damaged forever.

### How are affections calculated?

### Are there welfare units in this game? And if so, are they permanently missable?

> Yes. No.

### Where can I repair my damaged dolls?

### What's the best way to farm a map drop doll?

> Resource efficiency: What formation and least amount of dolls that would be able to minimize damage while being able to clear fights.
>
> Time efficiency: Routes that take the least amount of turns. If S-ranking the map requires effort, then don't.
>
> Drop efficiency: All fights should be able to drop the farmable doll as much as possible. Take as little non-drop fights or as many drop chances per run.
>
> Note that is just a base guideline and not a rule. Or just copy from others.
