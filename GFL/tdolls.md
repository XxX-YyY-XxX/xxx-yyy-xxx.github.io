### Why are the guns' names excluding their manufacturer names?

> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We modified some names to avoid licensing risk. We thank you for your understanding.</p>&mdash; Girls&#39; Frontline-EN Official (@GirlsFrontlineE) <a href="https://twitter.com/GirlsFrontlineE/status/1001058278728548354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### How do I know the final value of the doll stats? And what are the caps for each stat?

> [Matsuda Formula.](https://gfl.matsuda.tips/post/basicformula)
>
> 99999 for final damage. FOR ROF, it's listed on the formation screen, but in reality, it's by 5, so max for 120 is 116, i.e. 116-120 ROF has no difference. Crit Rate is 100% as per common sense.

### Can I set the damaged art as default for dolls?

> Only on the main screen as an adjutant, unless you want them critically damaged forever.

### The speech bubble hearts, SKK. What do they mean?

> Dorm? Tap them to gain Â¼ of an affection.
>
> Echelon portrait? At 100 affection pts.

### Are there welfare units in this game? And if so, are they permanently missable?

> Yes. No.

### Where can I repair my damaged dolls?

> Repair button at the main menu. You can also repair them on helipads pre and post-deployment. **Do note though that repairing post-deployment cost twice the resources and locks you out of S rank (gold) medals.**

> Around 90 to maximize the ICD up to 100 if there's a run-up.

### Do I need to level up my duplicates in order to use them as dummy-links?

> Nope. They're merely DPS and health multiplier basically. Pretty much used as the equivalent of limit-break fodders in other gachas.

### What's the best way to farm a map drop doll?

> Resource efficiency: What formation and least amount of dolls that would be able to minimize damage while being able to clear fights.
>
> Time efficiency: Routes that take the least amount of turns. If S-ranking the map requires effort, then don't.
>
> Drop efficiency: All fights should be able to drop the farmable doll as much as possible. Take as little non-drop fights or as many drop chances per run.
>
> Note that is just a base guideline and not a rule. Or just copy from others.
